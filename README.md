## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost (install using `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/BalaSatish03/solar-radiation-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd solar-radiation-prediction


## Usage

1. Prepare your solar radiation dataset in a CSV format with appropriate columns.

2. Modify the `config.py` file to specify the file path of your dataset and other configuration parameters.

3. Run the main script:
4. The script will train different regression models and output the accuracy results. The Extra Tree Regressor model will be saved as `extra_tree_regressor_model.pkl`.
